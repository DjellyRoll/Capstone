		<h2>Satisfactory Academic Progress</h2>
		<p>Question: <b>Do I meet all the SAP requirements?</b>
		<p>Detail: SAP stands for Satisfactory Academic Progress and is a measurement of your progress toward completing a program of study.  There are four conditions explained below that you must meet in order to maintain your SAP.  You can also see the WWU page that describes the SAP requirement <a href="http://catalog.wwu.edu/content.php?catoid=10&navoid=1800">here</a>.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>Grade Point Average.</b> A GPA of 2.0 must be maintained. You can find your GPA <a href="https://mywestern.wwu.edu/">here</a>. 
				<p></p>
			<li>
				<b>Quarterly Credit completion requirements.</b> This means that you must complete the number of credits required for your enrollment status.  For example, if your enrollment status is full time, then you should complete at least 12 undergraduate credits this quarter.  A grade of F, Z, U, NP, K, W, I, X, XM, NX, SW and audited classes or the absence of a grade will not count toward meeting this requirement. 
				<p></p>
			<li>
				<b>Pace.</b> You must successfully complete at least eighty percent of the total number of courses you attempt.  Attempted credits are defined as all credits that appear on the academic history record. These credits include all repeated, failed, incomplete, withdraws, and transfer credits on your transcript.  Dropping a class after the fifth day of the quarter for any reason will affect your Pace score.  You can calculate your Pace score <a href="http://www.finaid.wwu.edu/client_services/pages/pace_calculator.php">here</a>.
				<p></p>
			<li>
				<b>Maximum Attempted Credits.</b> The MAC policy states that you cannot get Financial Aid funds to enroll in more than 125% of the credits required to complete your program.  In other words, if you have taken too many courses without graduating, you put your Financial Aid at risk.  Dropping a class after the fifth day of the quarter for any reason will affect your MAC score.  You can calculate your attempted credits by getting an unofficial transcript <a href="https://mywestern.wwu.edu/">here</a>.  Add all the courses on your record for the total number of credits attempted, then divide that number by the number of credits required for graduation by your program.  Multiply that by 100 for your MAC percentage. For example, since 180 credits are typically required to graduate, then 225 credits would exceed the cumulative course load allowed - though some degree programs vary slightly.  You may petition the Financial Aid office to exceed the MAC in some circumstances. 
				<p></p>
		</ol>
		<p>Verify that you meet all the SAP requirements now, then verify that after you drop credits that you will still meet each of the four requirements.  You can use the worksheet below.</p>
