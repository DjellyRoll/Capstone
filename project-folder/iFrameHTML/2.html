		<h2>CURRENT FINANCIAL AID STATUS</h2>
		<p>Question: <b>What is my Financial Aid status today?</b>
		<p>Details: The primary purpose of financial aid programs is to help students successfully complete their degree or certificate program in a timely way. Financial aid programs include grants, tuition and fee waivers, work study employment, need-based and non-need-based loans, and scholarship programs.  This tool can be used by anyone who has received financial aid, but if you are already on a special Financial Aid status, then you should speak to a Financial Aid counselor in person as soon as possible.  Go to Web4U to verify your current Financial Aid Status, and use that to choose the next step.</p>
