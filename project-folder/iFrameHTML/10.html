		<h2>PREVIOUS FINANCIAL AID WARNING</h2>
		<p>Question: <b>Is this a Warning quarter for me? </b>
		<p>You have reached this step because you didn't meet a requirement.  If this is the first time that this is the case, then make plans to ensure that you will meet all requirements going forward.  Any student who is already in a Warning quarter who doesn't meet all the requirements will be ineligible for aid next quarter.  You can check to see if you are on Warning on Web4U.</p>
