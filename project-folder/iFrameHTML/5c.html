		<h2>ENROLLMENT STATUS </h2>
		<p>Question: <b>Will dropping courses maintain or change your enrollment status?</b>
		<p>Detail: Every student has an enrollment status of Full Time, Three-quarter Time, Half Time, or Less than Half Time. Your enrollment status is important for calculating your aid.  I If you drop too many credits then it could change your enrollment status and affect your aid.  Reducing enrollment status after Financial Aid has been disbursed means you might have to repay it.</p>
		<p>Verify that you meet all the SAP requirements now, then verify that after you drop credits that you will still meet each of the four requirements.  You can use the worksheet below.</p>
		<table border="2" style="width:70%">
			<tr>
				<th>Standing</th>
				<th>Full Time</th>
				<th>Three-quarter time</th>
				<th>Half time</th>
				<th>Less than Half time</th>
			<tr>
				<td>Undergraduate</td>
				<td>12+ credits</td>
				<td>9 to 11 credits</td>
				<td>6 to 8 credits</td>
				<td>1 to 5 credits</td>
			<tr>
				<td>Graduate</td>
				<td>8+ credits</td>
				<td>6 to 7 credits</td>
				<td>4 to 5 credits</td>
				<td>1 to 3 credits</td>
		</table>
		
		<p>If you drop a course, but you still have enough credits to stay in the same category, then your enrollment status does not change.  For example, if you drop from 16 to 12 undergraduate credits, your enrollment status stays at full time.  If you drop from 16 to 11, your enrollment status changes from full time to three-quarter time.  Dropping a class after the fifth day of the quarter for any reason will still affect your Satisfactory Academic Progress by changing your Pace and MAC scores. </p>
<p>
My current enrollment status is:__________.  After I withdraw from class(es), my new enrollment status will be:__________. </p>
