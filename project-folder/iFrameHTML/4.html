		<p>Question: <b>How far into the quarter is today's date?</b>
		<p>Details: During the first five business days of the quarter, making changes is less complex, and it is possible to have your Financial Aid adjusted to reflect the changes you make in your course load and enrollment status.  To withdraw from a course during the first five days of the quarter, complete the transaction on Web4U.  Through close of business on the second Friday of the quarter, it is still possible to have your aid adjusted, but if you don't meet all requirements then you risk a formal warning or even suspension of your aid.  To withdraw from a course after the first five days of a quarter, a student must present the request in person at the Registrar's Office.  After the second Friday of the quarter, making changes is more complex, and this choice carries a higher risk of Financial Aid Warning or Financial Aid Suspension.</p>
